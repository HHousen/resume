## Work Experience

<!-- You have to wrap the "left" and "right" half of these headings in spans by
hand -->
### <span>Machine Learning Intern</span> <span><span><a href="https://ada.cx">Ada Support</a> (Remote)</span> <span>May 2022 -- Aug 2022</span></span>

- Conducted **>60 experiments** and trained >110 models to increase the accuracy of Ada's intent classification pipeline.
- Experimented with knowledge transfer, unsupervised learning of sentence embeddings, multi-task learning, and contrastive losses in the context of transformers and SVMs.
- My technique **improved production accuracy by 8%** using only 3% of production data.

### <span>Undergraduate Researcher</span> <span><span>Cornell University AI</span> <span>Sept 2021 -- May 2022</span></span>

- Overcame bias in paraphrase identification by using transformers & out-of-distribution detection techniques. Advised by Dr. Sernam Lim at Meta AI. Published in ICML 2022, [Principles Of Distribution Shift](https://sites.google.com/view/icml-2022-pods/) Workshop.
- Experimented with zero-shot image classification via OpenAI’s CLIP model.

### <span>Machine Learning Intern</span> <span><span><a href="https://ada.cx">Ada Support</a> (Remote)</span> <span>May 2021 -- Aug 2021</span></span>

- Led the discovery and experimentation phases of a project to enable Ada chatbots to better understand non-English languages.
- Wrote a data processing pipeline to efficiently clean and analyze **9 billion** chat messages for machine learning models.
- Researched novel techniques in multilingual intent prediction and cultivated skills in PyTorch, transformers, and pandas.

## Projects

### <span>AI Lecture Notes Generation</span> <span><span><a href="https://haydenhousen.com/projects/lecture2notes/">lecture2notes</a></span> <span>Sept 2019 -- Jan 2022</span></span>

- Conducted [scientific research](https://haydenhousen.com/media/lecture2notes-paper-v1.pdf) and created a state-of-the-art system to summarize classroom lectures using deep learning, computer vision, and NLP. Source on [GitHub](https://github.com/HHousen/lecture2notes/).
- Named a **top 300 scholar in the 2021 Regeneron Science Talent Search**, the nation’s oldest and most prestigious science and math competition for high school seniors.
- Deployed ML pipeline in production via a [full-stack website](https://lecture2notes.com/) powered by Docker, Flask, Celery, Bootstrap, and Stripe.

### <span>Neural Summarization Library</span> <span><span><a href="https://github.com/HHousen/TransformerSum">TransformerSum</a></span> <span>Mar 2020 -- Oct 2020</span></span>

- Furthered research in neural-network text summarization models with a focus on long document summarization.
- 4.45x smaller than the state-of-the-art model but 94% as accurate at release. 10+ pre-trained models available.
- Designed with code readability and thorough documentation as top priorities. **300+ stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/HHousen/TransformerSum)**.

### <span>AI Snow Day Prediction</span> <span><span><a href="https://haydenhousen.com/projects/will-i-have-a-snow-day/">Will I Have A Snow Day.com</a></span> <span>Dec 2019 -- Sept 2020</span></span>

- Created an AI-powered automatic snow day predictor website that improves itself over time using user feedback. Powered by scikit-learn, Materialize.css, SendGrid, and Flask. Source on [GitHub](https://github.com/HHousen/willihaveasnowday).
- Correlated **100GB+** of weather data from NOAA with school closings to select good features and train a gradient boosting classifier.

### <span>Cybersecurity Challenges</span> <span><span>CTFs</span> <span>Sept 2019 -- Current</span></span>

- Placed in **top 3%** on average in the PicoCTF [2019](https://github.com/HHousen/PicoCTF-2019)/[2021](https://github.com/HHousen/PicoCTF-2021)/[2022](https://github.com/HHousen/PicoCTF-2022) competitions. Wrote detailed writeups to document my learning and help others.
- Continuously practicing ethical hacking skills by solving HackTheBox.com machines and [publishing writeups](https://htb.haydenhousen.com/).
